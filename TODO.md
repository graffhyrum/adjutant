I am designing a cross-platform application to post to multiple social media platforms simultaneously for my spouse.  The core user flow is:
- Select a picture/video/attachment(s) from a mobile device
- Draft a post
- Select which platforms to post to.
- Send the posts
- Confirm the posts are sent per-platform.

I am considering extending the functionality to:
- Pull friends/contacts and aggregate their socials to allow cross-platform mentions on platforms that allow it.
- Track mass posts in local storage to allow for 'undo-ing' a mass post.
